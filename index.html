Odin lived in Asgard, the home of the Norse gods. As well as being god of war, battle, victory and death, he was also the god of magic, poetry, prophecy and wisdom.<b> Like most of the gods, he didn’t stay in Asgard all the time.</b> When he came down to earth, which they called Midgard, he wandered about in a long dark blue cloak, with a beautiful silver clasp with letters called runes engraved on on it. These runes contained magic spells.<br><br>

Odin’s cloak had a hood, to keep him dry, as umbrellas hadn’t been invented yet - and a traveller’s stick to help him beat back the bushes and branches back as he walked along. for there were no roads like there are today. <font>As Odin was the father of the gods, we imagine him to look quite old. Which maybe he was, and maybe he wasn’t, for gods are immortal, aren’t they?</font> Odin is often pictured with a very long white beard which reached down below his knees. You could say he looked rather like Gandalf: Tolkien did, who wrote the book Gandalf is in, so he ought to know. <br><br>

Or you might say, that he couldn’t possibly have had such a long beard as it was bound to get tangled and dirty, though perhaps as he was a god, he could keep it clean. <i>Or, you could say what is definitely true, that he was very good at disguising himself, and he could and often did look quite different.</i> But seeing all the sorrows and troubles that would happen to humankind, he also knew what he could do to help. For even though the gods really have no need to trouble themselves about us mortals, and our puny lives and petty sufferings, they do actually care - at least some of the time.<br><br>

And that is the story of how Odin got his True Wisdom, and of how he lost his eye.
